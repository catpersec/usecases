#### Main table
| Date | What | Folder | Tags | Note |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2022-09-20 | Web scraping / Beautiful Soup | web scraping | web-scraping, BeautifulSoup, sorting, local-files, 100DoC-d45 | Examples show how to deal with web scraping. In this particular case I did https://news.ycombinator.com/ and [empireonline.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20200518073855/https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/best-movies-2/) scarping. Vital aspect was sorting list of dictionary objects (solution based on [programiz tutorial](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/list/sort)). At the end of the lesson 45 (100DoC) I recalled how to [append text in local files](https://codeigo.com/python/append-text-to-a-file) and how to [remove files](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_file_remove.asp) using **os** module.|

#### Other
##### sort() vs sorted
+ sort does not return the sorted list; rather, it sorts the list in place.
+ sorted does it
